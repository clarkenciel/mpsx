## Recommended Implementation Order

Based on learning value and complexity progression:

1. **Start Here**: `true`, `false`, `echo`, `pwd` - Build confidence with simple utilities
2. **Text Basics**: `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `tr`, `cut` - Learn file I/O patterns  
3. **File Operations**: `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `chmod` - Understand file system interactions
4. **Text Processing**: `sort`, `uniq`, `grep` - Algorithm implementation practice
5. **System Tools**: `ls`, `ps`, `find` - Complex system interactions
6. **Advanced**: `sed`, `awk`, `make` - Language processing and build tools

## Notes

- **mwc** is already implemented as a word count utility (equivalent to POSIX `wc`)
- Utilities marked as ‚≠ê are excellent next steps for learning
- Some utilities like `sh` (shell) are extremely complex and might be beyond the scope of this educational project
- Consider implementing utilities in the recommended order to build skills progressively
- Each utility should include comprehensive man page research and integration tests as per project guidelines
